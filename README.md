Farm Layout Calculator
This Farm Layout Calculator is a web-based tool designed to help farmers, gardeners, and land planners efficiently design their land for crop planting. The tool allows users to input the dimensions of their land, water channels, and beds, and provides a graphical representation of the layout along with key calculations such as the number of beds, water channels, and crops that can be planted.

Key Features:
User Inputs: Enter the size of your land (length and width), the dimensions of main and sub-water channels, the size of each bed, and the crop spacing.
Graphical Layout: The tool generates a graphical representation of the farm layout with color-coded sections for:
Main water channels (blue)
Sub-water channels (light blue)
Planting beds (green)
Crop locations (brown circles)
Bed boundaries (red outlines)
Dynamic Calculations:
Number of beds based on land size and bed dimensions.
Total number of water channels (main and sub).
Total number of crops that can be planted in each bed and across the entire land.
Color-Coded Visualization: Easily distinguish different sections of the layout through a clear color scheme.
Real-Time Updates: Adjusting any of the inputs updates the graphical layout and calculations instantly.
Technology Stack:
HTML5: For the structure of the webpage.
Tailwind CSS: For a clean and responsive design.
JavaScript: For dynamic calculations and canvas drawing.
Canvas API: To render a clear and interactive layout of the farm design.
How to Use:
Input the Land Dimensions: Enter the length and width of your land.
Specify Water Channels and Beds: Define the size of the main water channels, sub-water channels, and bed dimensions.
Set Crop Spacing: Determine the spacing between crops within each bed.
View Results: The tool will calculate the total number of beds, water channels, and crops, displaying them both numerically and visually.

This repository is intended for developers, farmers, and hobbyists looking for an easy and effective way to plan their farm or garden layout visually. Feel free to fork the project and contribute with improvements or additional features!
